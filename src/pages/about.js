        The Original Beef of Chicagoland, simply known as The Beef, was the family business of the Berzattos. 
        It was originally run by Mikey Berzatto, but after his passing was passed down to his younger brother Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto.
        </p>
        <p>Carmen returned to Chicago from New York, where he had become a renowned chef, to run the restaurant with his sister Natalie and his brother’s best friend Richie. 
        Together, they revamped the menu, hired a talented staff, and transformed the restaurant into a modern and elegant place, while still honoring Michael’s vision and values.</p>
        <p>
        "The Bear" a nickname given Michael to Carmy Berzatto, is now a modern fine dining experience with Chicago's talented chefs.

        <p>Hi, I’m Carmy, the executive chef and co-owner of The Beef, a sandwich shop in Chicago that serves delicious and creative food.</p> 
        <p>I have a passion for cooking and a vision for transforming the traditional sandwich into a culinary masterpiece. </p>
        I have worked in some of the finest restaurants in New York City, and I have learned from some of the best chefs in the world. I returned to my hometown to take over my family’s legacy and revitalize the restaurant with my innovative and creative vision. I lead my team with a mix of tough love and mentorship, and I strive to create the best food possible for my customers. I’m also a proud brother, a loyal friend, and a survivor of trauma. I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a chef and as a person. I hope you enjoy my food and my story. Welcome to The Bear!</p>
